There's a hundred and four days
of summer vacation
and school comes along just to end it
so the annual problem
with our generation
is finding a good way to spend it

like maybe
building a rocket
or fighting a mummy
or climbing up the eiffel tower
discovering something that doesn't exist
or giving a monkey a shower

riding tidal waves
building nano bots
or locating frankenstein's brain

finding a dodo bird
painting a continent
or driving your sister insane

as you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do
before school starts this fall
so come with us cuz phinease and ferb are gonna do it all
so stick with us cuz phinease and ferb are gonna do it all
